    <p class="a">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is essential in web development for separating content (HTML) from presentation, enabling cleaner, more maintainable code.  It allows developers to control layout, colors, fonts, animations, and responsive designs, ensuring websites look great and function well across all devices. By applying styles globally through a single CSS file, changes to design elements—like button colors or font sizes—can be made instantly across an entire website, saving time and effort. CSS also improves website performance through browser caching, speeds up page loading, and enhances user experience. With 97.1% of websites using CSS (per W3Techs), it remains the standard for modern web design and a must-learn skill for developers.
